_I was asked back in September 2019 to offer some advice to new grad students starting out in physics at Syracuse. The goal, I was informed, was to offer some encouragement and prospective. This text was ostensibly going to make its way to the physics department's website. Maybe it's all the preach-y-ness but my opus has yet to make it to the department website! Scandal. I offer it below with only the most gentle editing.  NOW GET OFF MY LAWN!_
